# Apple Vision Pro Website Clone

This repository contains a website project that replicates the design and interactive elements of the Apple Vision Pro showcase. The website includes smooth animations, interactive canvas components, videos, and other engaging features.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates various concepts and technologies, including:

- **Smooth Scrolling:** Using Locomotive Scroll and GSAP for smooth animations and scroll-triggered effects.
- **Interactive Videos and Canvas Animations:** Integrates video backgrounds and canvas animations for dynamic visual effects.
- **Pinning and Scroll-Triggered Effects:** Leverages GSAP ScrollTrigger to create engaging transitions and animations during scrolling.
- **Custom Design Elements:** Incorporates custom styling and layout to emulate the Apple Vision Pro website.

## Code Structure

- **HTML:** Defines the structure and layout of the website, including navigation, sections, and multimedia elements.
- **CSS:** Styles the website, ensuring a consistent look and feel. It also handles responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript:** Contains scripts for animations, scroll interactions, and canvas-based animations.

## Technologies Used

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** For creating complex animations and scroll-based interactions.
- **Locomotive Scroll:** Enables smooth scrolling with additional functionality for synchronizing with GSAP animations.
- **External Resources:** The project references video and image resources from external sources, such as Apple.com.
